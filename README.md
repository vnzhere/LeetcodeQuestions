This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, written mainly in C++ (and may include other languages in the future).
The goal of this repo is to:

-Practice data structures & algorithms
-Improve problem-solving skills
-Maintain a personal reference for revision
-Build a public coding portfolio

📂 Repository Structure
Problems are organized by topic:
leetcode/
  arrays/
  strings/
  searching/
  sorting/
  recursion/
  linked-list/

Each file usually contains:
-Problem number & name
-My approach
-Time & space complexity


🧠 What You’ll Find
For most problems:
// Problem: 704. Binary Search
// Approach: Iterative binary search
// Time: O(log n)
// Space: O(1)


🚀 Languages Used
C++ (primary)
More coming soon (Java)


🎯 Purpose
This repository is part of my learning journey in:
-Data Structures & Algorithms
-Competitive Programming
-Interview Preparation
-All solutions are my own implementations written for learning purposes.
